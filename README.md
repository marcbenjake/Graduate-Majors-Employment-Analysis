## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Address Gender Pay Disparity
- Implement targeted scholarships for women in high-earning fields
- Create mentorship programs connecting female students with STEM/Business professionals
- Mandate transparent salary disclosures

### 2. Enhance Career Counselling
- Require labour market analysis courses before major declaration
- Create real-time employment outcome dashboards
- Warn students about high-risk majors

### 3. Restructure High-Risk Programs
- Reduce enrollment in consistently poor-outcome majors
- Mandate internships for high-risk fields (Communications, Arts)
- Audit curriculum gaps in high-unemployment categories
- Develop hybrid degree programs

### 4. Improve Employment Quality
- Partner with employers for guaranteed placement programs
- Create employer consortiums for problematic majors

### 6. Manage Earnings Variability
- Provide pathway guidance for high-variability fields
- Develop income-share agreements for high-risk majors
- Show full earnings distributions, not just medians
